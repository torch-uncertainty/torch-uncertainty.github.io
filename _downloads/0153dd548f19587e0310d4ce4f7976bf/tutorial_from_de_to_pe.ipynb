        "# Improved Ensemble parameter-efficiency with Packed-Ensembles\n\n*This tutorial is adapted from a notebook part of a lecture given at the [Helmholtz AI Conference](https://haicon24.de/) by Sebastian Starke, Peter Steinbach, Gianni Franchi, and Olivier Laurent.*\n\nIn this notebook will work on the MNIST dataset that was introduced by Corinna Cortes, Christopher J.C. Burges, and later modified by Yann LeCun in the foundational paper:\n\n- [Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio, and P. Haffner. \"Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition.\" Proceedings of the IEEE.](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98.pdf)\n\nThe MNIST dataset consists of 70 000 images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The images are grayscale and 28x28-pixel sized. The task is to classify the images into their respective digits. The dataset can be automatically downloaded using the `torchvision` library.\n\nIn this notebook, we will train a model and an ensemble on this task and evaluate their performance. The performance will consist in the following metrics:\n- Accuracy: the proportion of correctly classified images,\n- Brier score: a measure of the quality of the predicted probabilities,\n- Calibration error: a measure of the calibration of the predicted probabilities,\n- Negative Log-Likelihood: the value of the loss on the test set.\n\nThroughout this notebook, we abstract the training and evaluation process using [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/)\nand [TorchUncertainty](https://torch-uncertainty.github.io/).\n\nSimilarly to keras for tensorflow, PyTorch Lightning is a high-level interface for PyTorch that simplifies the training and evaluation process using a Trainer.\nTorchUncertainty is partly built on top of PyTorch Lightning and provides tools to train and evaluate models with uncertainty quantification.\n\nTorchUncertainty includes datamodules that handle the data loading and preprocessing. We don't use them here for tutorial purposes.\n"

        "The training time should be approximately similar to the one of the single model that you trained before. However, please note that we are working with very small models, hence completely underusing your GPU. As such, the training time is not representative of what you would observe with larger models.\n\nYou can read more on Packed-Ensembles in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09184) or the [Medium](https://medium.com/@adrien.lafage/make-your-neural-networks-more-reliable-with-packed-ensembles-7ad0b737a873) post.\n\n## To Go Further & More Concepts of Uncertainty in ML\n\n**Question 1:** Have a look at the models in the \"lightning_logs\". If you are on your own machine, try to visualize the learning curves with `tensorboard --logdir lightning_logs`.\n\n**Question 2:** Add a cell below and try to find the errors made by packed-ensembles on the test set. Visualize the errors and their labels and look at the predictions of the different sub-models. Are they similar? Can you think of uncertainty scores that could help you identify these errors?\n\n### Selective Classification\n\nSelective classification or \"prediction with rejection\" is a paradigm in uncertainty-aware machine learning where the model can decide not to make a prediction if the confidence score given by the model is below some pre-computed threshold. This can be useful in real-world applications where the cost of making a wrong prediction is high.\n\nIn constrast to calibration, the values of the confidence scores are not important, only the order of the scores. *Ideally, the best model will order all the correct predictions first, and all the incorrect predictions last.* In this case, there will be a threshold so that all the predictions above the threshold are correct, and all the predictions below the threshold are incorrect.\n\nIn TorchUncertainty, we look at 3 different metrics for selective classification:\n- **AURC**: The area under the Risk (% of errors) vs. Coverage (% of classified samples) curve. This curve expresses how the risk of the model evolves as we increase the coverage (the proportion of predictions that are above the selection threshold). This metric will be minimized by a model able to perfectly separate the correct and incorrect predictions.\n\nThe following metrics are computed at a fixed risk and coverage level and that have practical interests. The idea of these metrics is that you can set the selection threshold to achieve a certain level of risk and coverage, as required by the technical constraints of your application:\n- **Coverage at 5% Risk**: The proportion of predictions that are above the selection threshold when it is set for the risk to egal 5%. Set the risk threshold to your application constraints. The higher the better.\n- **Risk at 80% Coverage**: The proportion of errors when the coverage is set to 80%. Set the coverage threshold to your application constraints. The lower the better.\n\n### Grouping Loss\n\nThe grouping loss is a measure of uncertainty orthogonal to calibration. Have a look at [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16315) to learn about it. Check out their small library [GLest](https://github.com/aperezlebel/glest). TorchUncertainty includes a wrapper of the library to compute the grouping loss with eval_grouping_loss parameter.\n\n"
